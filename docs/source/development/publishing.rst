Publishing the Package
**********************

As you make changes to the project, you'll probably want to publish new version
of the package.  *(That's the point, right?)*

Publishing
==========

The actual process of publishing the project is just a matter of running the
:ref:`publish <make-publish>` target.

.. code-block:: bash

    make publish

Installing
==========

If you just need to install the library in your project, have a look at
the :ref:`general tutorial <getting_started>` article.
