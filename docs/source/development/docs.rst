Building the Documentation
**************************

Sphinx
------

The documentation in this project is generated by
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_
from `reStructuredTex <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

Ubuntu/Debian
-------------

This project started on `Ubuntu Linux 18.04 <http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/>`_.
That doesn't mean you can't use another distribution, or even another operating
system, but you may need to perform some additional setup steps to get your
builds working.  (If you do get it working under another system, please consider
adding an article to let others know how you did it!)

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project uses the Sphinx
`LatexBuilder <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/builders/index.html#sphinx.builders.latex.LaTeXBuilder>`_
to generate a `PDF <https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/about-adobe-pdf.html>`_
document.  If you're using Ubuntu (or Debian) you'll need to install
`texlive <https://www.tug.org/texlive/>`_ and
`latexmk <https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended \
        texlive-latex-extra \
        texlive-fonts-recommended \
        latexmk

make
----

Once everything is in place, you can build the documentation using the
:ref:`make docs <make_docs>` the target defined in the project's
:ref:`Makefile <make>`.

.. code-block::

    make docs
